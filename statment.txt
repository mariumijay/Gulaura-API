1. Project Purpose

This project is a backend API for a flower shop. Its goal is to manage all core business operations in a structured, automated way. Using FastAPI, it will allow you to:

Track flowers in inventory

Process and manage customer orders

Handle delivery logistics

Keep customer info organized

Generate reports for sales and inventory

Allow building custom bouquets or arrangements

The idea is to simulate a real-world shop backend using modern API practices.

2. Key Functional Modules

The project is split into separate modules for modularity. This makes the code easier to maintain, test, and scale.

Inventory (inventory/)

Manage all flowers available in the shop

Include categories (roses, lilies, etc.), quantity, price

Operations(DONE): add new flowers ( create /post ), update stock (update), remove discontinued flowers(delete), fetch inventory(get)

Orders (orders/)

Handle customer orders (done)

Track order status: pending, processed, shipped, delivered (done)

Support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for orders (done)

Could include filtering by date, total price, or customer  (done)

Customers (customers/)

Maintain customer information: name, contact, address

Operations: add new customer(done), update info(done), retrieve customer history(done)

Delivery (delivery/)

Track delivery status for orders

Update delivery info: in transit, delivered, delayed

Could integrate with external delivery APIs in the future

Analytics (analytics/)

Generate reports for sales, inventory levels, and popular flowers

Could calculate revenue per month, most sold flowers, etc.

3. Data Management

Uses JSON files (data/) for lightweight storage

Each module has its own JSON file: flowers, orders, customers, deliveries

This simulates a simple database without needing SQL

Key Point: JSON is easy for testing, but in production, you might switch to a proper database like PostgreSQL.

4. Pydantic Models (models/schemas.py)

Defines data validation rules using FastAPI’s Pydantic models

Examples of validations:

Prices > 0

Quantities >= 0

Valid dates for orders/delivery

Pydantic ensures data integrity before it even reaches your business logic.

5. Utilities (utils/helpers.py)

Functions for repetitive tasks, like:

Reading/writing JSON files

Calculating total order amounts

Checking stock availability

Keeps main endpoints clean and readable

6. FastAPI Features in Use

RESTful API Design

Uses proper HTTP methods: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove)

Path & Query Parameters

Fetch inventory by category or price range

Filter orders by customer or status

Error Handling

Uses HTTPException to return proper HTTP status codes (404 for not found, 400 for bad request)

Partial Updates

Update only the fields needed, like order status or delivery info

Modular Architecture

Each module handles a single responsibility, making code easier to test and extend

Custom Responses

Returns clear JSON messages with proper codes: 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found

7. Environment Variables (.env)

Could store sensitive info, like admin credentials or API keys

Keeps secret data out of your codebase

8. Main Application Entry (main.py)

Imports all modules and registers routers

Starts the FastAPI app

Central place for middleware and global configurations

9. Project Goals & Benefits

Centralized flower shop management

Easy to expand: add coupons, payments, or a real database later

Provides REST API endpoints that can connect to a frontend (mobile app, website, etc.)

Teaches FastAPI best practices: modular design, Pydantic validation, error handling, JSON storage
